## 🌟 Overview

**Sixur Game** (also known as *KurdishSpy*) is a web-based multiplayer game designed for parties, cafes, and family gatherings. 

The concept is simple: One player is the **Sixur** (Spy), and everyone else is a **Civilian** at a specific location. The Civilians must find the spy, while the spy must figure out the location—all without revealing too much!

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Kurdish Culture**: Categories specifically for local foods, traditions, and social habits.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Lobby:** Create a room on one device. Select your settings (Categories, Timer, # of Spies).
2.  **Handover:** Pass the device around. Each player taps to see their role:
    *   **Civilian:** You see the **Secret Word/Location**.
    *   **Sixur (Spy):** You see **"YOU ARE THE SPY"**. You have no idea where you are!
3.  **Questions:** Players take turns asking each other questions about the secret location.
    *   *Goal:* Expose the Spy without revealing the location too clearly.
    *   *Spy's Goal:* Blend in and guess the location.
4.  **Verdict:** At any time, vote to catch the Spy, or if you are the Spy, reveal yourself and guess the location to steal the win!
